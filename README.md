I’m @HumzaTebai
I’m interested in C++ and DSP
I’m currently learning C++ and deepening my DSP knowlegde
I have a huge 30 years+ experience in music, sound design and sound engineering backed up with a good career, still ongoing...
I’m looking to collaborate on DSP projects.
My email absynthesizerz@hotmail.com

Useless information: I like to seprate my functions and modules in cpp like this ---> //---Module title---.
I find it reduces visual clutter and the sense of being lost in lala-land. 

Thank you.
